# Fishfriends - Fish Stories for the Modern Day

This is a web app that allows a user to create a profile with a username and password, and add logs associated with their time spent fishing. Logs are searchable by user and location, and are shared publicly on a map. This allows users to share information (or misinformation!) about their fishing trips with other aspiring fishermen. These are "fish stories" for the 21st century. Buckle up.
